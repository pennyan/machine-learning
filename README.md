support vector regression
================

I implemented three solvers for support vector regression

1. Stochastic gradient descent for primal problem.
2. Smoothe the primal problem and then do a quadratic programming (convex).
3. Optimization for smoothed primal problem using kernel trick (non-convex).

Value Added:
1. I did both the original primal problem and the smoothed version.
2. I implemented stochastic gradient descent on original problem and used quadratic programmming on the smoothed primal.
3. I kernelized the primal problem. Test cases are using rbfKernel and polyKernel.
